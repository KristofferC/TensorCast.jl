# [TensorCast.jl](https://github.com/mcabbott/TensorCast.jl)

This package lets you write complicated formulae in index notation,
which are turned into Julia's usual broadcasting, permuting, slicing, and reducing operations. 

Version 0.2 is a re-write, see the [release notes](https://github.com/mcabbott/TensorCast.jl/releases/tag/v0.2.0) to know what changed from version 0.1.5.

2. `@reduce` and `@matmul`, for summing over some directions
